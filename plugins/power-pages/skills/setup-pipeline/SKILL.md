# setup-pipeline

Sets up a **Power Platform Pipeline** for automated Power Pages solution deployments. Creates the pipeline configuration directly in Dataverse using the PP Pipelines OData API — no YAML files, no external CI/CD infrastructure needed.

GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipeline options are shown in the platform menu as **coming soon**.

> Refer to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/cicd-pipeline-patterns.md` for all HAR-confirmed API patterns used in this skill.

## Prerequisites

- `powerpages.config.json` exists in the project root
- `.solution-manifest.json` exists (solution must be created first via `setup-solution`)
- Azure CLI logged in (`az account show` succeeds)
- PAC CLI logged in (`pac env who` succeeds)
- A Power Platform environment with Pipelines package installed (the "host" environment)

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Detect Project Context

**Create all tasks upfront at the start of this phase.**

Tasks to create:
1. "Detect project context"
2. "Select CI/CD platform"
3. "Confirm pipeline configuration"
4. "Run preflight checks"
5. "Create deployment environments"
6. "Create pipeline and stages"
7. "Verify and write artifacts"

Steps:

1. Read project context using `detect-project-context.js`:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/detect-project-context.js"
   ```
   Capture output as JSON; extract `.siteName` (store as `siteName`), `.websiteRecordId`, `.environmentUrl` (store as `devEnvUrl`), and `.solutionManifest` (store as `solutionManifest`). If `siteName` is absent (no `powerpages.config.json`), stop and advise running `/power-pages:create-site` first. If `solutionManifest` is null (no `.solution-manifest.json`), stop and advise running `/power-pages:setup-solution` first.

   **Manifest version check:**
   - If `solutionManifest.schemaVersion === 2` (multi-solution layout), set `MULTI_SOLUTION_MODE = true` and store `solutionManifest.solutions[]` as `SOLUTIONS_LIST`. One pipeline will be created per solution.
   - If `schemaVersion` is absent or `1` (single solution), read `solutionManifest.solution.uniqueName` and `solutionManifest.solution.solutionId`. One pipeline will be created (existing flow).

2. Run `verify-alm-prerequisites.js` to confirm PAC CLI auth, acquire a token, and verify API access:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/verify-alm-prerequisites.js" --envUrl "{devEnvUrl}"
   ```
   Capture output as JSON; extract `.envUrl` (use to confirm `devEnvUrl`) and `.token` (store as `DEV_TOKEN`).

3. Run silently:
   ```bash
   pac env list --output json 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Store output as `ENV_LIST`.

4. Run `discover-pipelines-host.js` on the dev env to find the tenant's Pipelines host environment:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/discover-pipelines-host.js" \
     --envUrl "{devEnvUrl}" \
     --token "{DEV_TOKEN}" \
     --userId "{userId}"
   ```
   Capture stdout as JSON: `const hostResult = JSON.parse(output)`.
   If `hostResult.found` is true, store `hostResult.hostEnvUrl` as `HOST_ENV_URL`.
   If `hostResult.found` is false, no default host is configured — will need to ask user.

5. Cross-reference `HOST_ENV_URL` with `ENV_LIST` to confirm the host environment appears in `pac env list` output. Match on the URL or `EnvironmentId` field.

   If not found in `ENV_LIST`: set `HOST_ENV_URL = null` (will ask user in Phase 3).

6. Check for existing `.last-pipeline.json` in the project root. If found, read its contents.

7. Report findings: "Project: `{siteName}`. Solution: `{uniqueName}`. Dev env: `{devEnvUrl}`. Host env: `{HOST_ENV_URL ?? 'not auto-detected'}`. Existing pipeline: found/not found."

**If an existing `.last-pipeline.json` is found**, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "A pipeline configuration already exists for `{pipelineName}` (created {createdAt}). How would you like to proceed?
> 1. Overwrite — create a new pipeline, replacing the marker
> 2. Review existing setup first, then decide
> 3. Cancel"

- If **Review**: display the existing `.last-pipeline.json` contents, then ask again with the same 3 options.
- If **Cancel**: stop the skill and inform the user no changes were made.
- If **Overwrite**: proceed.

### Phase 2 — Select CI/CD Platform

Ask user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Which CI/CD platform do you want to use?
> 1. **Power Platform Pipelines** — Microsoft's native deployment pipeline. No external infrastructure needed. (Recommended)
> 2. **GitHub Actions** — Coming soon
> 3. **Azure DevOps Pipeline** — Coming soon"

If the user passed `power-platform`, `github`, or `ado` as an argument, skip this question and use the provided value.

Store the selection as `PLATFORM`.

**If `github` or `ado` selected** → display the [Coming Soon path](#coming-soon-path) and stop.

## Power Platform Pipelines Path

### Phase 3 — Confirm Pipeline Configuration

Before asking any questions, assemble what was auto-detected:

| Setting | Auto-detected value |
|---|---|
| Site name | `{siteName}` from `powerpages.config.json` |
| Solution unique name | `{uniqueName}` from `.solution-manifest.json` |
| Dev environment URL | `{devEnvUrl}` from `pac env who` |
| Host environment URL | `{HOST_ENV_URL}` from `RetrieveSetting` (if found) |
| BAP environment ID (dev) | From `pac env list` |

Ask user via `AskUserQuestion` with pre-filled values:

> "I've gathered the following pipeline configuration. Please confirm or correct:
>
> - **Pipeline name**: `{siteName} Pipeline` (can change)
> - **Source (Dev) environment**: `{devEnvUrl}`
> - **Host environment** (where Pipelines is installed): `{HOST_ENV_URL ?? "NOT DETECTED — please provide"}`
> - **Solution to deploy**: `{uniqueName}`
> - **Target environments**: How many? (Dev → Staging / Dev → Staging → Production)"

Collect from user:
- `PIPELINE_NAME` (default: `{siteName} Pipeline`)
- `HOST_ENV_URL` (confirm if auto-detected; ask if not)
- Target environment count and URLs (`STAGING_ENV_URL`, `PROD_ENV_URL` if applicable)
- BAP environment IDs for each target (from `pac env list` — pre-fill if found, otherwise ask)

Store `HOST_TOKEN` by running:
```bash
az account get-access-token --resource "{hostEnvOrigin}" --query accessToken -o tsv
```

Present a final confirmation summary and ask user to approve before proceeding.

### Phase 4 — Preflight Checks

Use Node.js `https` module for all Dataverse calls (curl has encoding issues on Windows).

**4.1 Verify host environment has Pipelines installed:**
```
GET {hostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.1/deploymentpipelines?$top=0
Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN}
```
If response is 404 or returns an "unknown entity" error, stop and inform the user: "The selected host environment does not have Power Platform Pipelines installed. Please select a different environment or install the Pipelines package."

**4.2 Verify solution exists in dev environment** using `verify-solution-exists.js`:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/verify-solution-exists.js" \
  --envUrl "{devEnvUrl}" \
  --uniqueName "{uniqueName}" \
  --token "{DEV_TOKEN}"
```
Capture output as JSON; check `.found`. If `false`: warn the user — the solution must be exported from dev before it can be deployed.

**4.3 Check for existing pipeline with same name:**
```
GET {hostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.1/deploymentpipelines?$filter=name eq '{PIPELINE_NAME}'&$select=deploymentpipelineid&$top=1
Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN}
```
If found: ask via `AskUserQuestion` whether to use the existing pipeline ID or create a new one with a different name.

Report preflight results. If any critical check failed, stop with clear instructions. If warnings only, ask user to confirm before proceeding.

### Phase 5 — Create Deployment Environments

Create Dataverse `deploymentenvironment` records for each environment. Process source env first, then targets.

Use `create-deployment-environment.js` for each environment (dev source + each target):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/create-deployment-environment.js" \
  --hostEnvUrl "{HOST_ENV_URL}" \
  --token "{HOST_TOKEN}" \
  --name "{siteName} {label}" \
  --environmentUrl "{environmentUrl}"
```
Capture stdout as JSON: `const envResult = JSON.parse(output)`.
Store `envResult.deploymentEnvironmentId` as `SOURCE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID` (for the dev source env) or append to `TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_IDs` (for each target).

> **Note**: The script POSTs to `deploymentenvironments` with `msdyn_name`, `msdyn_url`, and `msdyn_type`, extracts the GUID from the `OData-EntityId` header, then polls `msdyn_validationstatus` every 3 seconds (max 20 attempts) until status `192350001` (Succeeded) or `192350002` (Failed). On failure the script writes the error details to stderr and exits 1 — stop and report the error to the user.

On failure: stop with the error — deployment environment creation is mandatory.

Report progress for each environment as validation completes.

### Phase 6 — Create Pipeline, Associate Source, Create Stages

Use `create-deployment-pipeline.js` to create the pipeline, associate the source environment, and create all stage records in one call:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/create-deployment-pipeline.js" \
  --hostEnvUrl "{HOST_ENV_URL}" \
  --token "{HOST_TOKEN}" \
  --pipelineName "{PIPELINE_NAME}" \
  --description "Power Pages deployment pipeline for {siteName}" \
  --sourceDeploymentEnvironmentId "{SOURCE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}" \
  --stagesJson '[{"name":"Deploy to {targetLabel}","targetDeploymentEnvironmentId":"{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}","order":1}]'
```
Capture stdout as JSON: `const pipelineResult = JSON.parse(output)`.
Extract:
- `pipelineResult.pipelineId` → store as `PIPELINE_ID`
- `pipelineResult.stages` → array of `{ stageId, name, targetDeploymentEnvironmentId }`

> **What the script does internally:**
> 1. POSTs `{ msdyn_name, msdyn_description }` to `deploymentpipelines` (v9.2) — extracts `pipelineId` from `OData-EntityId` header
> 2. PUTs a `$ref` body to `deploymentpipelines({pipelineId})/msdyn_sourceenvironment/$ref` using the relative-path `@odata.id` format (HAR-confirmed — no leading `/` or full URL)
> 3. For each stage: POSTs `{ msdyn_name, msdyn_order, msdyn_pipelineid@odata.bind, msdyn_targetenvironmentid@odata.bind }` to `deploymentstages` — extracts `stageId` from `OData-EntityId` header

On failure: the script writes the error to stderr and exits 1 — stop and report the error to the user.

### Phase 6b — Multi-solution deploymentOrder (only if `MULTI_SOLUTION_MODE = true`)

> **Design note (updated v1.3.x):** A single Power Platform Pipeline can deploy
> multiple solutions through separate stage runs — each run just specifies a
> different `artifactname` + `solutionid` on the same `deploymentstages` record.
> Creating one pipeline per solution was wasteful and cluttered the Pipelines
> UI. **We now create ONE pipeline + one stage per target env, and record the
> per-solution deployment order in `.last-pipeline.json`**. `deploy-pipeline`
> then loops over the order, creating a stage run per solution against the same
> stage.

When the manifest is `schemaVersion: 2`, do **not** call `create-deployment-pipeline.js` multiple times. Instead:

1. Call `create-deployment-pipeline.js` **once** with:
   - `pipelineName = "{siteName}-Pipeline"` (e.g. `IdeaSphere-Pipeline`).
   - `description` listing the solutions that will deploy through it (e.g. `"Deploys IdeaSphere_Core → IdeaSphere_WebAssets → IdeaSphere_Future in order"`).
   - One `deploymentstages` record per target environment (not per solution).
2. Build the `deploymentOrder` array from `SOLUTIONS_LIST` sorted by `order`. Each entry has `{ solutionUniqueName, solutionId, order }`. Skip entries where `isFutureBuffer: true` AND `components.length === 0` — an empty Future solution has nothing to deploy; it's created by `setup-solution` but does not participate in the deployment loop until it has content. Keep it in the order array with `status: "skipped-empty"` so the renderer can show the intent.
3. Collect the single `pipelineId` and its `stages[]`. Persist `deploymentOrder` to `.last-pipeline.json` (see Phase 7).

### Phase 7 — Verify, Write Artifacts, Commit

**7.1 Verify pipeline was created:**
```
GET {hostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.1/deploymentpipelines({PIPELINE_ID})?$select=name,statecode
Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN}
```

Confirm `statecode = 0` (Active). If the query fails, report as "verification inconclusive — pipeline may still be valid".

**7.2 Write `.last-pipeline.json`** to the project root:

```json
{
  "pipelineId": "{PIPELINE_ID}",
  "pipelineName": "{PIPELINE_NAME}",
  "hostEnvUrl": "{HOST_ENV_URL}",
  "sourceDeploymentEnvironmentId": "{SOURCE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}",
  "sourceEnvironmentUrl": "{devEnvUrl}",
  "solutionName": "{uniqueName}",
  "createdAt": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stageId": "{deploymentstagesid}",
      "name": "Deploy to {targetLabel}",
      "rank": 1,
      "targetDeploymentEnvironmentId": "{TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}",
      "targetEnvironmentUrl": "{targetEnvUrl}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-solution marker (manifest v2):** When `MULTI_SOLUTION_MODE = true`, `.last-pipeline.json` uses `schemaVersion: 3` with a **single** pipeline and a `deploymentOrder[]` describing which solutions deploy through it, in what order:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "pipelineId": "...",
  "pipelineName": "IdeaSphere-Pipeline",
  "hostEnvUrl": "{HOST_ENV_URL}",
  "sourceDeploymentEnvironmentId": "{SOURCE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}",
  "sourceEnvironmentUrl": "{devEnvUrl}",
  "createdAt": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stageId": "...",
      "name": "Deploy to Staging",
      "rank": 1,
      "targetDeploymentEnvironmentId": "...",
      "targetEnvironmentUrl": "https://staging.crm.dynamics.com"
    }
  ],
  "deploymentOrder": [
    { "solutionUniqueName": "IdeaSphere_Core", "solutionId": "...", "order": 1 },
    { "solutionUniqueName": "IdeaSphere_WebAssets", "solutionId": "...", "order": 2 },
    { "solutionUniqueName": "IdeaSphere_Future", "solutionId": "...", "order": 3, "status": "skipped-empty", "isFutureBuffer": true }
  ]
}
```

> **Migration note:** Earlier versions of this skill used `schemaVersion: 2` with a `pipelines[]` array (one Dataverse pipeline record per solution). Projects pinned to v2 continue to work with the old `deploy-pipeline` MULTI_PIPELINE_MODE path; the v3 format should be used for all new setups. When re-running `setup-pipeline` on a v2 project, ask via `AskUserQuestion` whether to migrate (delete the N-1 extra pipelines and collapse to a single one) or keep the legacy layout.

**7.3 Write `docs/pipeline-setup.md`** (create `docs/` directory if needed):

Contents:
1. **Pipeline Created** — name, host env URL, pipeline ID
2. **Environments configured** — source + each target with their deployment environment IDs
3. **How to trigger a deployment** — Run `/power-pages:deploy-pipeline` or open Power Platform make.powerapps.com → Solutions → Pipelines
4. **Approval gates** (if applicable) — How to configure in Power Platform Admin Center
5. **Troubleshooting** — Common validation errors and how to resolve them

**7.4 Commit:**
```bash
git add .last-pipeline.json docs/pipeline-setup.md
git commit -m "Add Power Platform Pipeline configuration for {siteName}"
```

**7.5 Run skill tracking silently:**
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update-skill-tracking.js" \
  --projectRoot "." \
  --skillName "SetupPipeline" \
  --authoringTool "ClaudeCode"
```

**7.6 Present summary:**

| Resource | ID / URL |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | `{PIPELINE_NAME}` (`{PIPELINE_ID}`) |
| Host environment | `{HOST_ENV_URL}` |
| Source deployment env | `{SOURCE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV_ID}` |
| Stage: {name} | `{stageId}` → `{targetEnvUrl}` |

**Files written:**
- `.last-pipeline.json` — pipeline configuration marker
- `docs/pipeline-setup.md` — setup documentation

**Next step:**
> Run `/power-pages:deploy-pipeline` to trigger your first deployment run.

## Coming Soon Path

**If GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps was selected:**

Inform the user:

> "GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps Pipeline support are coming soon for this skill.
>
> **For now, you have two options:**
> 1. Use **Power Platform Pipelines** — select option 1 to set up Microsoft's native deployment pipeline (recommended)
> 2. Exit — I'll set up GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps manually using the documentation"

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
1. Switch to Power Platform Pipelines — go back to Phase 2
2. Exit — I'll set up manually

If GitHub/ADO passed as argument: display above message and exit gracefully.

---

## Key Decision Points (Wait for User)

0. **Phase 1**: Existing pipeline file — overwrite, review, or cancel (only if `.last-pipeline.json` found)
1. **Phase 2**: Platform selection (Power Platform Pipelines / GitHub coming soon / ADO coming soon)
2. **Phase 3**: Confirm pipeline configuration — pipeline name, host env URL, target environments
3. **Phase 4**: Preflight warnings — proceed or cancel
4. **Phase 3**: Parameter confirmation before pipeline creation

## Error Handling

- No `powerpages.config.json`: stop, advise `/power-pages:create-site`
- No `.solution-manifest.json`: stop, advise `/power-pages:setup-solution`
- `RetrieveSetting` returns empty: ask user for host environment URL manually
- Deployment environment `statecode = 1` with non-null `errormessage` (validation failed): stop with error details
- Pipeline `$ref` call fails: stop — this association is required before stages can be created
- Stage creation fails: record failure, continue with remaining stages — partial success is valid

## Progress Tracking Table

| Task subject | activeForm | Description |
