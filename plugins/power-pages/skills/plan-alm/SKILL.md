# plan-alm

An 8-phase orchestrator that gathers ALM strategy from the user, generates an HTML deployment plan, gets approval, then executes the plan by calling existing skills in sequence.

## Overview

This skill detects the current project state (existing solution, pipeline), asks targeted questions about the desired promotion strategy (Power Platform Pipelines or Manual export/import), generates a visual `docs/alm-plan.html`, gets user approval, and then invokes `setup-solution`, `setup-pipeline` (or `export-solution`), and `deploy-pipeline` (or `import-solution`) in the correct order.

**Do NOT create tasks at the start** — strategy is unknown until Phase 2 completes. Create all tasks in Phase 3 once the strategy is determined.

---

## Phase 1 — Detect Project State

**Do NOT create tasks yet.** Use natural language progress reporting only during this phase.

Steps:

1. Read `powerpages.config.json` from the project root (use `Glob` to find it). Extract:
   - `siteName` — the site's display name
   - `websiteRecordId` — the Power Pages website GUID
   - `environmentUrl` — dev environment URL

   If not found, stop with: "powerpages.config.json not found. Run `/power-pages:create-site` first."

2. Check for `.solution-manifest.json` in the project root:
   - Store `SOLUTION_DONE = true` if found, `false` otherwise
   - If found, read `solution.uniqueName` and store as `SOLUTION_UNIQUE_NAME`

3. Check for `.last-pipeline.json` in the project root:
   - Store `PIPELINE_DONE = true` if found, `false` otherwise
   - If found, read `pipelineName` and `stages[]` for later use

4. Run silently:
   ```bash
   pac env who
   ```
   Capture the `Environment URL` and display name. Store as `DEV_ENV_URL` and `DEV_ENV_NAME`.

5. Run silently:
   ```bash
   pac env list --output json 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Store output as `ENV_LIST` for pre-filling environment URLs in Phase 2.

6. Acquire dev environment token (silently):
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/verify-alm-prerequisites.js" --envUrl "{DEV_ENV_URL}"
   ```
   Store `.token` as `DEV_TOKEN` and `.userId` as `userId`. If this fails (auth error), set `DEV_TOKEN = null` and continue — contents discovery will be skipped gracefully.

7. Discover and classify site settings (if `DEV_TOKEN` is available and `websiteRecordId` is known):

   Use Node.js `https` module to query:
   ```
   GET {DEV_ENV_URL}/api/data/v9.2/mspp_sitesettings?$filter=_mspp_websiteid_value eq '{websiteRecordId}'&$select=mspp_name,mspp_value&$top=500
   Authorization: Bearer {DEV_TOKEN}
   ```

   Classify each returned setting using this three-tier logic:

   **Tier 1 — Excluded (true credentials, never add to solution):**
   Name matches `/ConsumerKey|ConsumerSecret|ClientId|ClientSecret|AppSecret|AppKey|ApiKey|Password/i`
   These are OAuth/identity credential fields — adding them to a solution would expose secrets.

   **Tier 2 — Auth config (per-environment auth settings):**
   Name matches `Authentication/` or `AzureAD/` (but NOT in Tier 1).
   These are authentication feature flags and configuration that may differ per environment.
   - If `mspp_value` is non-empty → **`promoteToEnvVar`**: recommend promoting to an environment variable during `setup-solution` so staging/production can use different values
   - If `mspp_value` is null or empty → **`authNoValue`**: include in solution as-is (no secret to protect), but show a note that this is an auth setting with no dev value and the user should verify the correct value is set in each target environment after deployment

   **Tier 3 — Regular settings (all others):**
   Everything else — Search, Bootstrap, WebApi field lists, feature flags, site tracking, etc.
   → **`keepAsIs`**: include in solution as-is regardless of whether a value is set. These settings do not need per-environment variation and no special treatment is required.

   Store as:
   ```js
   SITE_SETTINGS_DATA = {
     keepAsIs: [{name}],                    // regular settings (Tier 3)
     authNoValue: [{name}],                 // auth config with no dev value (Tier 2, no value)
     promoteToEnvVar: [{name, value}],      // auth config with dev value (Tier 2, has value)
     excluded: [{name}]                     // true credentials (Tier 1)
   }
   ```
   If the query fails, set `SITE_SETTINGS_DATA = null` and continue.

8. Build `SOLUTION_CONTENTS_DATA`:
   ```js
   {
     tables: solutionManifest?.components?.tables || [],     // from .solution-manifest.json if SOLUTION_DONE
     botComponents: solutionManifest?.botComponents || [],   // from manifest if available
     siteSettings: SITE_SETTINGS_DATA                        // from step 7, or null
   }
   ```
   If `SOLUTION_DONE = false` and manifest is absent, `tables` and `botComponents` will be empty arrays — the plan will show a note that they will be discovered during setup-solution.

9. Report to user:
   ```
   Found: **{siteName}** on `{devEnvUrl}`.
   Solution: {✓ already set up ({solutionUniqueName}) / ✗ not yet}.
   Pipeline: {✓ already set up ({pipelineName}) / ✗ not yet}.
   Site settings: {N total — K regular (keep as-is), P auth settings to review for env var, A auth settings (no dev value), E credential secrets excluded / unable to query}.
   ```

10. **Estimate solution size and evaluate the split decision tree.** Run the estimate helper to classify the site across size, component count, schema heaviness, web file aggregate, and env var count. Use the tmp-file write pattern — if the estimator fails, a prior good `.alm-size-estimate.json` is preserved instead of being overwritten with an empty/partial file:
    ```bash
    node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/estimate-solution-size.js" \
      --envUrl "{DEV_ENV_URL}" --websiteRecordId "{websiteRecordId}" \
      --publisherPrefix "{publisherPrefix}" --siteName "{siteName}" \
      --datamodelManifest "./.datamodel-manifest.json" > ./.alm-size-estimate.json.tmp \
      && mv ./.alm-size-estimate.json.tmp ./.alm-size-estimate.json
    ```
    Then run the decision tree (same tmp-file pattern):
    ```bash
    node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/compute-split-plan.js" \
      --estimate ./.alm-size-estimate.json \
      --projectRoot "." \
      --siteName "{siteName}" \
      --publisherPrefix "{publisherPrefix}" > ./.alm-split-plan.json.tmp \
      && mv ./.alm-split-plan.json.tmp ./.alm-split-plan.json
    ```
    If either command exits non-zero, stop and report the stderr message to the user. Do not proceed to Q1b in Phase 2 without a valid split plan.
    Store the output as `SPLIT_PLAN`. Fields to read: `splitStrategy`, `proposedSolutions[]`, `appliedStrategies[]`, `assetAdvisory`, `sizeAnalysis`, `recommendations[]`.

    If `SPLIT_PLAN.proposedSolutions.length > 1`, set `RECOMMEND_SPLIT = true`. Otherwise `false`.

    Report to the user:
    ```
    Estimated size: {totalSizeMB} MB — components: {count} — tier: {overall tier}.
    Decision tree result: {splitStrategy} → {N} solutions recommended.
    Asset advisory: {K} files flagged for Azure Blob externalization.
    ```

11. **Pre-plan completeness check** (only runs when `SOLUTION_DONE = true`).

    Before the user approves a plan, verify the existing solution already covers everything on the live site. Components created after the last `/power-pages:setup-solution` run (server logic from `add-server-logic`, flows from `add-cloud-flow`, env vars from `configure-env-variables` or `setup-auth`) are silently excluded from any plan built on top of a stale solution.

    Run the shared discovery helper against the source environment:

    ```bash
    node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/discover-site-components.js" \
      --envUrl "{envUrl}" --token "{token}" \
      --siteId "{websiteRecordId from powerpages.config.json}" \
      --publisherPrefix "{solutionManifest.publisher.prefix}" \
      --solutionId "{solutionManifest.solution.solutionId}"
    ```

    Parse stdout and evaluate `missing.*`:

    - **All `missing.*` arrays empty** → report "Solution contents match the site — proceeding with fresh plan inputs." Continue to Phase 2.
    - **Any non-empty `missing.*` array** → report a compact summary:
      > "Your solution is **missing {N} component(s)** that exist on the site:
      >
      > - **{X}** site components (e.g. {first 3 names})
      > - **{Y}** cloud flows
      > - **{Z}** environment variable definitions
      > - **{W}** custom tables
      >
      > A plan built now will ignore these components. How would you like to proceed?"

      Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

      | Question | Header | Options |
      |---|---|---|
      | Run `/power-pages:setup-solution` in sync mode to adopt the missing components before planning? | Completeness Check | Yes — sync first (Recommended), No — plan with current solution contents, Cancel |

      - **Yes, sync first (Recommended)**: invoke `/power-pages:setup-solution` (auto-detects the existing manifest and enters sync mode). After it completes, re-run the discovery helper; if `missing.*` is now empty proceed to Phase 2, otherwise repeat the prompt.
      - **No, plan with current contents**: store the gap summary as `KNOWN_GAPS` so Phase 3 can surface it in the plan HTML's Risks section, then continue.
      - **Cancel**: stop the skill so the user can investigate.

    > **Why this exists**: the same check runs at export (`export-solution` Phase 2.5) and deploy (`deploy-pipeline` Phase 3.5). Adding it here catches gaps at the earliest possible gate — before the user invests time reviewing a plan built on stale inputs. See AGENTS.md → ALM-aware by default.

    > **Skip when `SOLUTION_DONE = false`**: if there is no manifest yet, there is nothing to be stale against — Phase 2 Q1 will handle first-time solution setup.

---

## Phase 2 — Gather ALM Strategy

Ask questions in sequence. **Solution is always Q1** — it is the prerequisite for all other steps. Branch after Q2 based on promotion strategy selection.

### Q1 — Solution Setup (always asked first)

**If `SOLUTION_DONE = true`** (manifest found in Phase 1):

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "A Dataverse solution is already configured for this site: **{SOLUTION_UNIQUE_NAME}**. Use this existing solution?"

Options:
1. **Yes, use the existing solution** — `setup-solution` will be skipped in the plan
2. **No, create a new solution** — set `SOLUTION_DONE = false`; `setup-solution` will run

**If `SOLUTION_DONE = false`** (no manifest found):

Tell the user (not via `AskUserQuestion` — informational only):
> "No Dataverse solution is set up for this site yet. **`setup-solution` will be the first step in your plan.** The publisher prefix you choose during setup is irreversible — choose carefully."

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Ready to include solution setup in the plan?"

Options:
1. **Yes, include solution setup** — continue
2. **I already have a solution (enter name)** — accept free-text solution unique name, set `SOLUTION_DONE = true`, `SOLUTION_UNIQUE_NAME = user input`

---

### Q1b — Split Recommendation (only if `RECOMMEND_SPLIT = true`)

The decision tree from Phase 1 Step 10 recommended splitting into multiple solutions. Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Based on the site size and component analysis, the recommended approach is **{splitStrategy}** — {N} solutions instead of one. Do you want to follow this recommendation?"

Options:
1. **Use the recommended split** — proceed with `proposedSolutions[]` from the decision tree. `setup-solution` will create all N solutions.
2. **Keep as a single solution anyway** — override to single. Record override reason; `setup-solution` creates one solution with all components.
3. **Accept Asset Advisory first** (only offered if `assetAdvisory.candidates.length > 0`) — user commits to externalizing the flagged assets. Recompute size excluding those files, re-run the decision tree, present the new recommendation.
4. **Show me migration guidance** (only offered if an existing `.solution-manifest.json` is found and does not match the recommendation) — produce `docs/alm-migration-plan.md` and exit. Do not execute.

**If option 1:** continue with `proposedSolutions`.
**If option 2:** override `SPLIT_PLAN.proposedSolutions` to the single-solution structure for rendering; record `overrideReason` in the plan.
**If option 3:** subtract advisory candidate sizes from the estimate, re-run `compute-split-plan.js`, re-present.
**If option 4:** write `docs/alm-migration-plan.md` (see the spec doc `solution-splitting-logic.md` §7), commit it, mark plan as Deferred, exit.

---

### Q2 — Strategy Selection (always asked)

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "How do you want to promote your solution between environments?"

Options:
1. **Power Platform Pipelines** — Microsoft's native CI/CD, managed deployments, approval gates
2. **Manual export/import** — export a zip from dev and import directly to each target environment
3. **I already have a pipeline set up** — run a deployment now
4. **Help me decide** — show a quick comparison

**If option 4 selected:** Explain:
> "Power Platform Pipelines is recommended for teams and multiple environments — it provides automated promotion, approval gates, and deployment history in one place. Manual export/import is simpler for one-off migrations or when you only need to deploy once. For ongoing CI/CD, choose Power Platform Pipelines."

Then re-ask Q2 with only options 1–3.

**If option 3 selected:** Read `.last-pipeline.json`, confirm pipeline name and stages, then skip to Phase 3 (generate plan) with `strategy = pp-pipelines`, `PIPELINE_DONE = true`.

---

### PP Pipelines Path — Q3 through Q7

**Q3:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "How many deployment stages do you want in this pipeline?"

Options:
1. **Staging only** — Dev → Staging (I'll add Production later)
2. **Staging + Production** — Dev → Staging → Production (full promotion chain)
3. **Production directly** — Dev → Production only (bypass staging)
4. **Custom** — I'll describe my own stage layout

If option 4: accept free-text description (via "Other") and build a stage list from the response.

Store stages as `PP_STAGES` (array of `{ label, envUrl }`). Dev is always the source.

**Q4 (auto-detect + confirm — host environment):**

Run silently using `discover-pipelines-host.js`:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/discover-pipelines-host.js" \
  --envUrl "{DEV_ENV_URL}" --token "{DEV_TOKEN}" --userId "{userId}"
```

- **If auto-detected:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
  > "Use detected Pipelines host environment `{HOST_ENV_URL}`?"
  Options: 1. Yes, use this / 2. Use a different host environment (enter via Other)

- **If not detected:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion` — pre-fill options from `ENV_LIST` (up to 3 known environment URLs from `pac env list`) plus "Other" for a custom URL. Pre-fill first option from `.last-pipeline.json` if present.

Store as `HOST_ENV_URL`.

**Q5:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Should deployments require approval before each stage?"

Options:
1. Required before each stage (Recommended for production)
2. Staging auto-approve, production requires approval
3. No approval gates — deploy automatically

Store as `PP_APPROVAL_MODE`.

**Note:** PP Pipelines always exports as a **managed** solution to target environments. Set `EXPORT_TYPE = "managed"` automatically — no question needed.

**Q6 (auto-detect, no question):** Check `.solution-manifest.json` for `envVarDefinitions` or components with `componenttype 380`. If found, set `HAS_ENV_VARS = true` — note in plan that `deploy-pipeline` will prompt for per-stage env var values. If manifest not present (SOLUTION_DONE=false), set `HAS_ENV_VARS = false` — variables will be discovered during setup-solution.

**Q7:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Is this project's code tracked in Git source control?"
> *(Informational only — this determines whether the plan includes a source control recommendation. No automation is applied.)*

Options:
1. Yes — we use Git (changes tracked before each deployment)
2. No — not using source control (plan will recommend enabling it before production)
3. Not yet set up (plan will include source control guidance)

Store as `GIT_STATUS`.

---

### Manual Path — Q3 through Q8

**Q3:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "How many target environments do you need to deploy to?"

Options:
1. One target (e.g. Production)
2. Two targets (e.g. Staging then Production)
3. Dev only — not deploying yet

Store as `MANUAL_TARGET_COUNT`.

If option 3: set `MANUAL_TARGET_COUNT = 0`. Proceed to Q5.

**Q4 (one per stage):** For each target environment needed, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "What is the URL for target environment {N}?"

Pre-fill from `ENV_LIST`: show up to 3 known environment URLs from `pac env list` as options, plus "Enter a different URL" as the last option.

Store target URLs as `MANUAL_TARGETS` (array).

**Q5:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "How should the solution be exported?"

Options:
1. Managed — for staging/production (cannot edit in target)
2. Unmanaged — for dev-to-dev (editable in target)

Store as `EXPORT_TYPE`.

**Q6:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Do you want a checkpoint pause between export and import for review?"

Options:
1. Yes — pause after export so I can review the zip before importing
2. No — proceed automatically

Store as `MANUAL_CHECKPOINT` (`true` or `false`).

**Q6 (auto-detect, no question):** Same as PP Pipelines Q6 — check for env var definitions.

**Q7:** Same as PP Pipelines Q7 — Git source control status.

---

## Phase 3 — Generate HTML Plan

**Now create all tasks** — strategy is known.

### Task creation

**For PP Pipelines path**, create these tasks (in order):

| # | Subject | activeForm | Description |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate ALM plan | Generating ALM plan | Build planData, render docs/alm-plan.html |
| 2 | Approve ALM plan | Awaiting plan approval | Present inline summary, get user confirmation |
| 3 | Setup solution | Setting up solution | Invoke setup-solution skill (conditional) |
| 4 | Setup pipeline | Setting up pipeline | Invoke setup-pipeline skill (conditional) |
| 5..N | Deploy to {stageName} | Deploying to {stageName} | Invoke deploy-pipeline skill for this stage — one task per target stage |
| 5..N+1 | Activate site in {stageName} | Activating site in {stageName} | Check activation status + invoke activate-site if not yet provisioned — one task per target stage |
| N+2 | Finalize | Finalizing | Update HTML status, commit, run skill tracking |

Create one **Deploy to {stageName}** + **Activate site in {stageName}** task pair for each target stage in `PP_STAGES` (e.g. Staging, Production).

**For Manual path**, create:

| # | Subject | activeForm | Description |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Generate ALM plan | Generating ALM plan | Build planData, render docs/alm-plan.html |
| 2 | Approve ALM plan | Awaiting plan approval | Present inline summary, get user confirmation |
| 3 | Setup solution | Setting up solution | Invoke setup-solution skill (conditional) |
| 4 | Export solution | Exporting solution | Invoke export-solution skill |
| 5..N | Import to {targetLabel} | Importing solution | Switch PAC CLI context, invoke import-solution (one task per target) |
| N+1 | Activate site in {targetLabel} | Activating site | Check activation status, invoke activate-site if not yet provisioned (one task per target, optional) |
| N+2 | Finalize | Finalizing | Update HTML status, commit, run skill tracking |

If `SOLUTION_DONE = true`, add `(will skip — already set up)` to the setup-solution task description.
If `PIPELINE_DONE = true` (PP path), add `(will skip — already set up)` to the setup-pipeline task description.

**Activation steps (PP path):** Create a separate **"Activate site in {stageName}"** task for every target stage. After each `deploy-pipeline` invocation succeeds, the activation task for that stage runs immediately — do not wait until all stages are deployed. The planData `steps` array must include one `"Deploy to {stageName}"` + one `"Activate site in {stageName}"` pair per target stage. Activation happens after every stage deployment — not just Production.

**Activation steps (Manual path):** For the Manual path, create one "Activate site in {targetLabel}" task per target environment. These run after the corresponding import completes.

Mark task 1 ("Generate ALM plan") as `in_progress`.

### Build planData

Build a `planData` object with all gathered strategy inputs:

```json
{
  "SITE_NAME": "{siteName}",
  "GENERATED_AT": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "STRATEGY": "pp-pipelines | manual",
  "EXPORT_TYPE": "managed | unmanaged",   // PP Pipelines path: always "managed"
  "APPROVAL_MODE": "{approvalMode description}",
  "GIT_STATUS": "yes | no | not-yet",
  "HAS_ENV_VARS": true | false,
  "SOLUTION_DONE": true | false,
  "PIPELINE_DONE": true | false,
  "PLAN_STATUS": "Draft",
  "APPROVED_BY": "",
  "APPROVAL_DATE": "",
  "stages": [
    { "label": "Dev", "envUrl": "{devEnvUrl}", "type": "source" },
    { "label": "Staging", "envUrl": "{stagingUrl}", "type": "target" },
    { "label": "Production", "envUrl": "{prodUrl}", "type": "target" }
  ],
  "steps": [
    { "name": "Setup solution", "status": "pending", "skip": false },
    { "name": "Setup pipeline", "status": "pending", "skip": false },
    { "name": "Deploy via pipeline to Staging", "status": "pending", "skip": false },
    { "name": "Activate site in Staging", "status": "pending", "skip": false },
    { "name": "Deploy via pipeline to Production", "status": "pending", "skip": false },
    { "name": "Activate site in Production", "status": "pending", "skip": false }
  ],
  "risks": [
    { "type": "info", "message": "..." }
  ],
  "solutionContents": {
    "tables": ["{table1}", "{table2}"],
    "botComponents": [{ "name": "..." }],
    "siteSettings": {
      "keepAsIs": [{ "name": "..." }],
      "promoteToEnvVar": [{ "name": "...", "value": "..." }],
      "excluded": [{ "name": "..." }]
    }
  },

  // --- v2 fields from the split decision tree (Phase 1 Step 10) ---
  "sizeAnalysis": { /* tier-classified signals from SPLIT_PLAN.sizeAnalysis */ },
  "assetAdvisory": { /* candidates + recommendation from SPLIT_PLAN.assetAdvisory */ },
  "splitStrategy": "single | strategy-1-layer | strategy-2-change-frequency | strategy-3-schema-segmentation | strategy-4-config-isolation",
  "appliedStrategies": ["strategy-1-layer"],
  "proposedSolutions": [ /* from SPLIT_PLAN.proposedSolutions */ ],
  "recommendations": [ /* from SPLIT_PLAN.recommendations */ ],
  "envVars": [ /* optional: env var metadata with per-environment values */ ],
  "breakdown": { /* bytes-per-category from the estimate */ },
  "estimationMethod": "metadata-based",
  "estimationAccuracyPct": 15
}
```

`solutionContents` is populated from `SOLUTION_CONTENTS_DATA` built in Phase 1. If discovery was unavailable, pass `null` — the renderer will show a fallback note.

**v2 fields** (`sizeAnalysis`, `assetAdvisory`, `splitStrategy`, `proposedSolutions`, `recommendations`, `envVars`, `breakdown`) come straight from `SPLIT_PLAN` computed in Phase 1 Step 10, mutated by Q1b user choices. Pass them through unchanged to the renderer.

Populate `risks` based on gathered data:
- If `HAS_ENV_VARS = true`: `{ type: "warning", message: "This solution has environment variables — you will be prompted for per-stage values during deployment." }`
- If `GIT_STATUS = "no"`: `{ type: "info", message: "Consider enabling source control to track changes before deploying to production." }`
- If `EXPORT_TYPE = "unmanaged"` and strategy includes a production target: `{ type: "warning", message: "Unmanaged solutions can be edited in the target environment — consider using Managed for production." }`
- If `SOLUTION_DONE = false`: `{ type: "info", message: "A Dataverse solution will be created first — publisher prefix is irreversible once chosen." }`
- If `KNOWN_GAPS` is set (the pre-plan completeness check in Phase 1 Step 11 found gaps and the user chose to continue): `{ type: "warning", message: "{X} site components, {Y} cloud flows, {Z} env vars, and {W} custom tables exist on the site but are not in the current solution. This plan will not promote them — run /power-pages:setup-solution sync mode before deploying, or re-run plan-alm after syncing." }`. Substitute the counts from `KNOWN_GAPS.missing.*.length`.

Write `planData` to `docs/.alm-plan-data.json` (create `docs/` if it doesn't exist).

### Render the HTML plan

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plan-alm/scripts/render-alm-plan.js" \
  --output "<projectRoot>/docs/alm-plan.html" \
  --data "<projectRoot>/docs/.alm-plan-data.json"
```

Delete `docs/.alm-plan-data.json` after success.

Write `.alm-plan-context.json` to the project root (persists so `setup-solution` can read it):
```json
{
  "generatedAt": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "siteName": "{siteName}",
  "siteSettings": {
    "keepAsIs": [{name}],
    "authNoValue": [{name}],
    "promoteToEnvVar": [{name, value}],
    "excluded": [{name}]
  }
}
```
This file is intentionally NOT deleted — `setup-solution` and other skills read it to skip re-discovery.

Mark task 1 as `completed`.

---

## Phase 4 — Present Plan and Get Approval

Mark task 2 ("Approve ALM plan") as `in_progress`.

Present a concise inline Markdown summary:

```
## ALM Plan: {siteName}

**Strategy:** {PP Pipelines / Manual export/import}
**Stages:** {Dev} → {Staging} → {Production (if applicable)}
**Approval gates:** {description from PP_APPROVAL_MODE, or "N/A — manual path"}
**Solution export:** {Managed / Unmanaged}

**Steps that will run:**
- [ ] Setup solution {(SKIP — already set up) if SOLUTION_DONE}
- [ ] Setup pipeline {(SKIP — already set up) if PIPELINE_DONE} {(PP path only)}
- [ ] Export solution {(manual path only)}
- [ ] Import to {targetLabel} × {N} {(manual path only)}
- [ ] Deploy via pipeline {(PP path only)}

Full plan written to: docs/alm-plan.html
```

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Does this ALM plan look correct?"

Options:
1. **Approve and execute the plan**
2. **Save plan but execute manually later**
3. **I want to change something** — go back to questions

- **If option 3:** Re-run Phase 2 (ask which section to change, then re-gather those answers). Regenerate the plan (repeat Phase 3). Re-present for approval.
- **If option 2:** Update HTML plan footer `plan-status` span to "Approved — Deferred" via `Edit` tool. Commit `docs/alm-plan.html` with message `"Add ALM plan for {siteName} (deferred)"`. Show next steps for manual execution. Mark task 2 as `completed`. Exit the skill.
- **If option 1:** Update the HTML plan `<span class="plan-status">` to "In Execution" via `Edit` tool. Record the approval timestamp in the HTML (`<span id="approval-date">`) by replacing the empty value. Mark task 2 as `completed`.

---

## Phase 5 — Execute: setup-solution (conditional)

**If `SOLUTION_DONE = true`:**
Mark the "Setup solution" task as `completed` with description "Skipped — solution already configured". Update the HTML checklist step for "Setup solution" to `status-skipped` via `Edit` tool. Skip to Phase 6.

**If `SOLUTION_DONE = false`:**
Mark the "Setup solution" task as `in_progress`. Update the HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress` via `Edit` tool.

Invoke the skill:
```
/power-pages:setup-solution
```

After completion: mark the task as `completed`. Update the HTML checklist step to `status-completed` via `Edit` tool.

---

## Phase 6 — Execute: setup-pipeline OR export-solution

### PP Pipelines path

**If `PIPELINE_DONE = true`:**
Mark the "Setup pipeline" task as `completed` with description "Skipped — pipeline already configured". Update HTML checklist step to `status-skipped`. Skip to Phase 7.

**If `PIPELINE_DONE = false`:**
Mark the "Setup pipeline" task as `in_progress`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

Invoke the skill:
```
/power-pages:setup-pipeline
```

After completion: mark task as `completed`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-completed`.

### Manual path

Mark the "Export solution" task as `in_progress`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

Invoke the skill:
```
/power-pages:export-solution
```

After completion: mark task as `completed`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-completed`.

**If `MANUAL_CHECKPOINT = true`:** Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Export complete. Review the solution zip at `{zipPath}` before importing. Ready to proceed with import?"

Options:
1. Yes, proceed with import
2. Stop here — I'll import manually later

If option 2: update HTML plan footer to "Approved — Deferred (paused after export)". Commit `docs/alm-plan.html`. Exit.

---

## Phase 7 — Execute: Deploy

### PP Pipelines path

**For each target stage in `PP_STAGES` (e.g. Staging, then Production), run this loop:**

**Step A — Deploy:**
Mark the "Deploy to {stageName}" task as `in_progress`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

Invoke the skill:
```
/power-pages:deploy-pipeline
```

After completion: mark deploy task as `completed`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-completed`.

**Step B — Activate (immediately after deploy for this stage):**
Mark the "Activate site in {stageName}" task as `in_progress`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

Read `.last-deploy.json` to check whether activation already happened inside `deploy-pipeline`:
```bash
node -e "const d=require('./.last-deploy.json'); process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({activationStatus: d.activationStatus, siteUrl: d.siteUrl}))"
```

- `activationStatus === "Activated"`: site is live. Mark task `completed`. Update checklist step to `status-completed`. Show site URL.
- `activationStatus === "Pending"` or `null`: activation was deferred or didn't run. Switch PAC CLI to the target environment and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

  > "**{siteName}** was deployed to **{stageName}** successfully. The site is not yet activated (not publicly accessible). Activate it now?"

  Options:
  1. **Yes, activate now** — invoke `/power-pages:activate-site`. After it completes, mark task `completed`, update checklist step to `status-completed`.
  2. **No, skip for now** — mark task `skipped`, update checklist step to `status-skipped`.

After handling activation, switch PAC CLI back to the dev environment:
```bash
pac env select --environment "{devEnvUrl}"
```

**Then repeat Step A + B for the next stage** (if any).

### Manual path (one import per target environment)

For each entry in `MANUAL_TARGETS`:

1. Mark the "Import to {targetLabel}" task as `in_progress`. Update the corresponding HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

2. Switch the PAC CLI context to the target environment:
   ```bash
   pac env select --environment "{targetEnvUrl}"
   ```

3. Invoke the skill:
   ```
   /power-pages:import-solution
   ```

4. After completion: mark the task as `completed`. Update the HTML checklist step to `status-completed`.

5. **Activate site in {targetLabel}** (optional) — mark the "Activate site in {targetLabel}" task as `in_progress`. Update HTML checklist step to `status-in-progress`.

   PAC CLI is already pointing to the target environment from step 2. Run the activation check:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-activation-status.js" --projectRoot "."
   ```

   - **`activated: true`**: Site is already live. Mark task as `completed`. Update checklist step to `status-completed`.
   - **`activated: false`**: Invoke `/power-pages:activate-site`. After completion, mark task as `completed`. Update checklist step to `status-completed`.
   - **`error`**: Mark task as `skipped`. Note error in summary.

After all imports: switch PAC CLI back to the dev environment:
```bash
pac env select --environment "{devEnvUrl}"
```

## Phase 8 — Finalize

Mark the "Finalize" task as `in_progress`.

### 8.1 Update HTML plan status

Update the HTML plan footer via `Edit` tool:
- Replace `<span class="plan-status">In Execution</span>` with `<span class="plan-status">Completed ✓</span>`
- Replace the completion timestamp placeholder with the current ISO timestamp

### 8.2 Run skill tracking

> Reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/skill-tracking-reference.md`

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update-skill-tracking.js" \
  --projectRoot "." \
  --skillName "PlanAlm" \
  --authoringTool "ClaudeCode"
```

### 8.3 Commit

```bash
git add docs/alm-plan.html && git commit -m "Add ALM plan for {siteName}"
```

### 8.4 Present final summary

Display a summary:

```
## ALM Complete: {siteName}

**Strategy used:** {PP Pipelines / Manual export/import}
**Skills invoked:** {comma-separated list of skills that ran}

**Artifacts created:**
- docs/alm-plan.html — ALM plan document
- .solution-manifest.json — Solution configuration {(if newly created)}
- .last-pipeline.json — Pipeline configuration {(PP path only, if newly created)}
- .last-deploy.json — Last deployment record {(PP path only)}
- {solutionName}_{managed|unmanaged}.zip — Solution package {(manual path only)}

**Site activation:** {
  PP path: "Activation status per stage is in .last-deploy.json and each deploy history file."
  Manual path: list each target env and its activation status (Activated / Pending)
}
```

Mark the "Finalize" task as `completed`.

## Key Decision Points (Wait for User)

1. **Phase 2, Q1**: Solution setup — confirm existing or include `setup-solution` in plan
2. **Phase 2, Q2**: Promotion strategy — PP Pipelines, Manual, or already set up
3. **Phase 2, Q3–Q7** (PP path): Stage count, host env, approval gates (managed auto-set), Git status
   **Phase 2, Q3–Q7** (Manual path): Target count, target env URLs, export type, checkpoint pause, Git status
4. **Phase 4**: Plan approval — execute, defer, or revise
5. **Phase 6, Manual**: Checkpoint pause after export (if Q6 = Yes)
6. **Phase 7 (delegated)**: Each invoked skill has its own approval gates

## Error Handling

- No `powerpages.config.json`: stop, advise `/power-pages:create-site`
- `pac env list` fails: skip ENV_LIST pre-filling; ask for environment URLs manually
- `render-alm-plan.js` fails (non-zero exit): report error, show planData JSON as fallback, ask user whether to proceed
- Invoked skill fails: report the failure, mark the task as blocked, ask user whether to retry or exit
- Plan approval = option 3 (change something): re-run Phase 2 fully, then regenerate plan — do not carry over stale answers
